\title{Title Normalization of given data}
\usage{
normalizeData(dataInput)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataInput}{dataInput should be a data frame composed of two columns. One is for time other is for intensity}
}
\value{
Function returns another data frame, scaling factors and scaling constants for time and intensity. The other data frame includes 2 columns one is for normalized time and the other is for noralized intensity. The whole time is distributed between 0 and 1 and similarly the whole intensity is distributed between 0 and 1. The time and intensity constants and scaling factors are the parameters to transform data from given set to scaled set.

Title Normalization of given data
}
\details{
Function maps the given time-intensity data into a recaled frame where time is between [x,1] and intensity is between [0,1]

# add usage examples here
# generateRandomData
time = seq(3,48,0.5)
intensity=runif(length(time), 3.0, 7.5)
dataInput = data.frame(time,intensity)

# Normalize Data
